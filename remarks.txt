Project 1 feedback:
- What about equal cost multi path? How to fix trace route tests in case we use it?
    - ECMP makes a hash function of layer 3 info such as source IP, dest IP, source port and dest port such that a single flow follows the same path.
    - After checking on my MAC, the trace route utility sends 3 UDP probes for increasing TTL. But for each new probe, it increases the dest port number by 1. So with ICMP, a given trace route will not follow a single path and could actually be a mix of the 2 paths.
    - We should check if the Cisco trace route does the same? If yes, can we freeze the dest port number?
    - If we can freeze dest port, how to rewrite our tests? Verify that we get one route among the possible routes?
    - If we cannot fix the dest port number, how to check routes?!
- Check for all combinaisons of prefixes advertised by the 3 external routers.
    - The goal of the exercice is to make sure our network behaves properly whatever the prefixes we receive for other AS.
    - We should check for deflections & loops with prefixes shared by 2 externals AS.
    - Find some way of automating the testing: check supposed exit point and verify if it matches.
    - We should modify the BGP topology if needed to fix the problems.
- Should we use null routes? I have seen in another Cisco tutorial that they were attributing the prefix to an interface on the router in order to announce it over BGP. What would be the advantage?
- Should our routers in main AS be reachable from the outside? What about loopback addresses? Think about a coherent answer.
- Add automated tests for BGP summary & routing tables (number of peers, etc.)
- Add a readme on how to run tests.
- Check with TCP dump for weird communications between routers.
- We should be able to explain each line in the configuration file.

Project 2:
- Fix issues. Propose a new solution. Check transient states.
- Real project implementing requirements in the forwarding plane.
    - Implement specific requirements.
    - We want that some specific paths are followed.
    - Think about how to implement these requirements?
    - Think about these requirements as special customersâ€¦
        - For one host, fast path.
        - For another, longer path but with higher bandwidth.
    - Can use IGP, BGP for implementing these requirements, but also MPLS & segment routing.
    - + Special gift for one group.
    - Go from simply it works to it works for additional precise constraints.
    - Could use different loopback addresses for hosts on the same external router and implement source traffic as we wish.
    - If its resilient to failure, it is better.
    - If we can explain why we design this way, to be resilient, or wants minimal overhead.
